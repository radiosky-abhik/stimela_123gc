# stimela_123gc

Flagging, calibration and imaging using stimela.

The current scripts are used to flag, calibrate & image GMRT data. The
scripts use a mixture of software like AoFlagger, CASA, MeqTrees,
WSClean to analyse the data sets.

The aim is to use 1gc (Direction Independent), 2gc (self-calibration) and 3gc (Direction Dependent) calibrations all together to improve the dynamic range or quality of the images. 

We are working on the 3gc part where as a part of direction dependent
effects ionosphere and the primary beam of the telescope will be
incorporated during direction dependent calibration.
